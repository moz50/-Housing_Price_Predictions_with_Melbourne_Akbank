# -Housing_Price_Predictions_with_Melbourne_Akbank

Project Name: House Price Forecast
Description
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict house prices in Melbourne. The data includes various attributes (number of rooms, number of bathrooms, plot size, etc.). First, data loading, cleaning and visualization were performed. Then, both Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor models were created and evaluated.

Project Steps
Importing Required Libraries
Data Loading and Cleaning
Data Exploration and Visualization
Decision Tree Regressor Modeling
Random Forest Regressor Modeling
Evaluation of Models
Selecting the Best Model
Model Optimization (Hyperparameter Tuning)
Visualization of Results
Project Files
housing_data.ipynb: Main project file, in Jupyter Notebook format.
melb_data.csv: Used data set (CSV format).
Used Libraries
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-Learn (sklearn)
According to the results, the Decision Tree Regressor shows a better performance and is therefore chosen as the final model.
